			<h1>Github Basic Repo Assignment</h1>
			<p>This is the Coding Dojo's Github Basic Repo assignment, so I'm going to keep it relatively bare and with few bells and whistles. However, I don't want it to be a complete snore, so I'm including some pictures I took at the Monterey Bay Aquarium of the jellyfish species Chrysaora fuscescens.</p>
			<p>As a side note, if you've never done a Google image search for "jellyfish types" I would highly recommend it.</p>
